          /*  Create a simple program named OperatorExercise in your repos folder to write out the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division operations.
            For division, create two integer variables called a and b.
Create a third integer variable and name it quotient(the result of a division) that stores the result of the division of a and b, and another integer variable named remainder that stores the remainder(using the % operator). Write out the results using Console.WriteLine or Console.Write to write out the results in the following form: if a = 17 and b = 4, print the following:	
17 / 4 is 4 remainder 1

#2

Create a method that will Calculate the area of a circle based on its radius -you can name the method AreaOfCircle
This method will use this formula pi *r ^ 2 and return the area of type double
The method will also accept r as a parameter
Allow a user to input a value for r in the console using the following code:
            var radius = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
          */
